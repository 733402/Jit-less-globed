# server changelog

least chaotic thing about this repo tbh

## game v1.0.2

* add two new packets: `ConnectionTestPacket` and `ConnectionTestResponsePacket`. used for testing the connection.

## central v1.0.1

* change the template game server ip address from `127.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` (oops)

## game v1.0.1

* don't include unauthenticated players in the room packet
