# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

This repository contains the complete rewrite of Globed, for Geometry Dash 2.2 and all future versions. If you want the 2.1 version, the [old repository](https://github.com/dankmeme01/globed) is still up, however it is no longer maintained.

## Installation

Globed is a [Geode](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode) mod, so it requires you to install Geode first. Once that's done, simply open the mods page in-game and download it from the index.

## Roadmap

Planned features:

* wait for 2.2

Known issues:

* i am silly
* voice chat is a bit silly
