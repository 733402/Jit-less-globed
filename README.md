# Globed

This repository is a complete rewrite of Globed, designed to be better in every way. The [old repository](https://github.com/dankmeme01/globed) will be archived with the release of 2.2 and all development will be done here, as the old versions of the mod were written with simplicity in mind, which made it hard to constantly add new features.

## Todo

* wait for 2.2

## Building

### Windows

Open the latest [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) release, download the asset called `libsodium-1.x.y-msvc.zip` and unzip it into `libs/`

Then just proceed with the CMake build.

### Mac

gotta figure it out somehow

### Android

no clue either
